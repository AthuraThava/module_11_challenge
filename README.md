**Do any unusual patterns exist?**

The search trends during May 2020, starts of with a high search trend value at the beginning of the day. Then graudually falls to a single digital search trends value by the time range of 8:00:00 - 10:00:00. The search trend value then increases to a higher value by the end of the day. This pattern repeats through the rest of the month for each day, creating a bouncy sideways trend pattern.

**Did the Google search traffic increase during the month that MercadoLibre released its financial results?**

The total monthly search traffic for May 2020 is: 38181
The total monthly median search traffic across all months is: 35172.5
The Google search traffic increased by 3008.5 during May 2020 when MercadoLibre released its financial results.

**Does any day-of-week effect that you observe concentrate in just a few hours of that day?**

The search concentration on days 5 and 6 is greater then the concentration on days 0 to 4 during the 6th hour. This change in concentration shifts the heatmap concentration for days 5 and 6 for the remainder of the day. The search concentration is more saturated before the 3 hour window and after the 20 hour window.

**Does the search traffic tend to increase during the winter holiday period (weeks 40 through 52)?**

The search trend during the winter holiday period (Weeks 40-52) increases until the week 51, excluding the small drop from weeks 40-42. The trend drastically drops down to a search trend value of 47 for week 52, one of the lowest points throughout the year.

**Do both time series indicate a common trend thatâ€™s consistent with this narrative?**

Both time series indicate a common trend throughout the period of January - June 2020. During the pandemic both time series trends had a downward drop from 02/25/2020 to 03/11/2020 creating a bear market for MercadoLibre. The introduction of new customers and revence in the e-commerce industry allowed the serach trends to recover. The stock market continued on a downward trend till 04/03/2020. When the increase in e-commerce revenue started affecting the market, MercadoLibre's closing prices started increasing as the search trend had.

**Does a predictable relationship exist between the lagged search traffic and the stock volatility or between the lagged search traffic and the stock price returns?**

**Based on the forecast information generated above, produce a sales forecast for the finance division, giving them a number for expected total sales next quarter. Include best and worst case scenarios, to better help the finance team plan.**

According to the forecast, the most likely situation is 970, while the best case is 1052 and the worst case is 886.
